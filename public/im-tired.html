        <p>The breeze against my skin felt colder than it should be.<br /></p>

        <p>
            I watched the leaves dancing along to the grace of the wind. How can
            something with no control, guided by the whims of a force beyond itself,
            look so free?<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            My gaze continued until it met the man walking up the dirt path towards
            me.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Following his lead were a group of six others, three on each of his sides.
            They all wore uniforms that had an insignia of a lion on its hind legs,
            wielding a sword.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            They continued up the dirt path, reaching me at the peak of the cliff that
            overlooked the village. <br />
        </p>

        <p>Once they were ten meters away, they stopped their movements.<br /></p>

        <p>
            The six others put their hands on the weapons attached to their hips.
            Ready to draw at a moment's notice.<br />
        </p>

        <p>The man in the middle took an extra step forward.<br /></p>

        <p>
            He reached into his coat pulling out a small pouch. Loosening the draw
            strings, he revealed a pendant in the shape of a Transvaal daisy.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            He tossed the pendant in front of me. As I was already kneeling on the
            ground, I reached in front of me picking it up.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            The craftsmanship was exquisite. As if a miniature version of the flower
            was preserved in time dawning a gold casing.<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Images began to flash in front of me as I recalled the moments I spent
            with the one I gave the pendant to. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            My eyes ignited with happiness. The best moments of my life began to surge
            through my head, flooding my cold heart with warmth. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            The feeling of warmth traveled through my body, reaching the tips of my
            fingers and toes. <br />
        </p>

        <p>Ignited eyes transformed into a burning fire. My breaths quickened, becoming shallower, becoming difficult,
            as if something removed the oxygen around me.<br /></p>

        <p>Anger and hatred began to fill my heart. A burning sensation filling my entire being, ready to erupt my skin
            into flames.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>The pressure around me was building. Becoming so heavy that the leaves no longer had any grace. <br /></p>

        <p>Six people tightened their grips on their side. Sweat building on their foreheads. A trickle of blood
            escaping from the lips of one, trying her best to fight the feeling growing around her.<br /></p>

        <p>Hatred and anger began to consume me. Hate.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Hate. <br /></p>

        <p>Anger. <br /></p>

        <p>Hate. <br /></p>

        <p>Vengeance. <br /></p>

        <p>Revenge. <br /></p>

        <p>Hate. <br /></p>

        <p>The sheer amount of pressure radiating from my body began to collapse. <br /></p>

        <p>My eyes and nose began to bleed, falling onto the pendant I held in my hands. <br /></p>

        <p>Guilt. <br /></p>

        <p>If only I did things differently. If only I realized things sooner. If only….
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>If only.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Regret.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>‘There’s still so many things we were supposed to do, so many places we planned to go..’
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“…” a shaky whisper came out of my mouth.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I placed the pendant in my inner breast pocket and began to stand up.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>The man continued to look at me, and waited till I got to my feet before opening his mouth.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“Remember this feeling. Many have gone through it before, just as you are experiencing it now...” <br /></p>

        <p>He slowly pulled his sword out of its sheath revealing an immaculate steel blade that reflected the light of
            the moon onto my face. <br /></p>

        <p>“... A feeling I am giving to you, as you have given to them.” He continued as the others to his side all
            unsheathed their weapons.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“This will not be quick, this will not be painless, but this will be the end.”
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>As the last words entered my ears, the six others suddenly disappeared.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I unsheath my sword, blocking a strike above my head.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Spinning to the side I swing my sword using my momentum feeling resistance in my arm.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>A thud could be heard on the ground next to me as a burning sensation spread across my back.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I pivoted to the side slashing diagonally downward before turning my grip and stabbing behind me. <br /></p>

        <p>Letting go of my sword, I crouch, hearing the sound of wind being split where my head once was.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Grabbing a handful of dirt, I quickly toss it toward the direction of where the sound originated from.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Picking up a sword that had fallen on the ground, I swipe at the ankle in front of me rolling forward into an
            upward diagonal slash.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Before I could stand completely, another burning sensation surfaced on my side.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I tumbled forward a bit, only catching myself by stabbing the sword into the ground to hold my weight. <br />
        </p>

        <p>I gritted my teeth, letting myself be consumed in the feelings I had before.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Appearing right next to one of the remaining two, I separated his head from his body.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>The last remaining one couldn’t even see what had just happened. And just as she was about to look over to
            where the man who hadn’t moved since the beginning of the current scene was, she began to wonder why the
            world seemed to be spinning.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I could barely see.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Blood blocked my vision, the burning sensation on my back and side grew more intense. <br /></p>

        <p>I could feel my eyelids growing heavy, my consciousness slowly fading. <br /></p>

        <p>The man who hadn’t moved just watched everything take place. <br /></p>

        <p>Less than fifteen seconds had passed since I drew my sword. <br /></p>

        <p>I dropped the sword I was holding and grabbed the hilt of my sword sticking out of the body of one of the
            six.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I turned around and slowly walked forward until there was around ten meters between me and him.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>He slowly put his sword in his sheath.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>One hand on his sheath, the other on the hilt of his blade. He leaned forward, legs slightly bent, face,
            looking at the ground in front of him.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I slowly sheathed my own sword. Taking the same stance as he.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>What seemed like hours was only a few seconds.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>The leaves that once again, were dancing along with the wind, glided by.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>As if on cue, the breeze suddenly stopped.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>At that moment, we both disappeared, appearing just two meters past each other.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I held my stance, sword in my right hand, extended out to the side. <br /></p>

        <p>I could hear him slowly straighten his posture, standing straight. He grabbed his sheath, put his sword
            inside, and took a step forward. <br /></p>

        <p>“The end.” He whispered, as he fell to the ground, lifeless.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I coughed a mouthful of blood, spitting it out in front of me.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Using my sword as a cane, I turned back around and made my way towards the edge of the cliff.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Unable to support my weight, I fell to my knees.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I pulled out the pendant from my pocket, trying to see its beautiful shape despite the world being so dark.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>But, despite everything being so dark, I could see her.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>She reached her hands out towards my face, the warmth of her hands against my cheek.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Just as I thought I must have died, I heard her soft and gentle voice.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“What’s bothering you hun?” Her voice caressed me as her words reached my ears.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I made eye contact with her before whispering a few words.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“I’m tired..”
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>She had a look of surprise on her face for a moment, before slowly becoming a gentle smile. <br /></p>

        <p>“Of course hun. Come, let's go to sleep.”
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>She slowly got down on her knees then sat on her heels.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>I felt my head gently being pulled towards her lap. I leaned forward and let myself go to her, resting my
            head on her lap.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>“Let's stay like this for a…” my last words, unrecognizable as I drifted asleep.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Later, someone would follow the dirt path up the cliff, noticing the horrific sight before them.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Seven bodies lay on the ground, blood everywhere.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>A single trail of blood would lead up to the edge of the cliff.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>They looked over the cliff wondering where the trail led to, unable to see anything through the dense trees
            far below.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Just as they were going to turn around, a glint would catch their eyes right below them.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>Crouching down to see what it was, they picked it up, rubbing the dried blood and dirt off.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>A Transvaal Daisy pendant.</p>
